    <h2>Héctor Raúl Silva Morales</h2>
    <p>Hello, my dear fellows, I am from Mexico.
        I am a persistent person, and I like the honesty of the people. Since my childhood, I faced bullying and challenges 
        with no fear because I know that if something is not killing me, it will strengthen me, so I am a man with a strong 
        and straight mind. With that conviction, I follow the commandments and keep my covenants, because I would like to 
        thank my Lord for the opportunities he gave me. I am taking the course because I need to refresh my knowledge and 
        I need an American Degree for getting better work in order to provide for my family. </p>
        <p>I hope to grow academically and spiritually to achieve my goals of being a better person, I would like to teach my 
        brothers in order to get a better life for all of us. I think after this course I will be a better person, closer 
        to the Lord, a good programmer, and a better member of my family. </p>
        <p>Next fourteen weeks I think we will develop a discipline to endure all the way until each one achieves his own goals. 
        I can cheer, help and support others in getting their dreams. </p>
    <h2>That is all for today ...</h2>
